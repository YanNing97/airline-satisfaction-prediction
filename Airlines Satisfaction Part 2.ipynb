    "<br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "CatBoost is an algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision trees. Instead of converting each categorical value into binary values, CatBoost applies an efficient encoding method that leads to an improvement in quality of the models by reducing overfitting (Eitle and Buxmann, 2019). It is ideally suited for applications with large amount of categorical data. In comparison to other machine learning methods, CatBoost does not require extensive data training, is robust as it does not need extensive hyper-parameter tuning and reduce the chances of overfitting (Ray, 2017).\n",

    "    This could be due to the nature of the dataset where it is not linearly separable and since the SVM with linear kernel is not able to find a hyperplane which maximises the margin, it is not able to give the optimal performance (Raschka, n.d.). On the other hand, the RBF kernel which is non-linear, creates non-linear combinations of the features and hence, shows better performance for our dataset. Thus, we will only be tuning the SVM model based on the RBF kernel.\n",

Hence, â€˜liblinearâ€™ is being used as it is a good choice for smaller datasets. Moreover, â€˜liblinearâ€™ handles â€˜l1â€™ penalty as well, which leads to a sparser solution. However, the accuracy of logistic regression with GridSearchCV is found to be relatively close to the one without GridSearchCV.
