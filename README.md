# Airline Satisfaction Prediction

## Problem Statement
Given the highly competitive airline industry, airline companies are required to consistently provide top-notch services. It is through customer insights where airline companies can have a better understanding of passengers’ satisfaction level towards the facilities, amenities and services offered at the airlines. Therefore, building classification models will help to predict and analyze the satisfaction level of passengers and at the same time provides insights for airlines companies to understand factors affecting the ratings of customer satisfaction.

## Motivation
In today’s age and uncertainty, airline companies need to stay competitive by keeping up with the changing demands through continuous development of their products and services. To ensure that they are relevant at all times, it is important for them to make full use of customer data that help them to make better informed business decisions. By having a deep understanding about the customers, companies are able to tweak their product offerings to suit customers’ needs and thus enhancing the customers’ experience and satisfaction level.

Predictive analytics can help airline companies to elevate customer loyalty by offering enhanced and personalised customer experience. This aims to ensure customer retention which results in driving business growth and profitability (Warner, n.d.). 

With the current pandemic, customers' insights are even more vital to airlines. With existing travel restrictions, airlines business are suffering and even pushing smaller airlines into bankruptcy (Chokshi, 2020). Without satisfactory services provided by airlines, customers will not be enticed to continue flying with the same airline. Hence, it is crucial for airline companies to achieve and maintain a high level of passenger satisfaction to ensure customer retention with not only existing but also potential customers.
